A simple chat.

## Requirements:
* 1 . Have a `php version 8^` and `mysql server` available.

## To unfold:
* 1 . import the database found inside `./config/db`, on your server.
* 2 . In the `./config/config.php` file, replace the value of the 
      variables with the data provided by your server: 
    * hostname: `$host`,
    * username: `$user`, 
    * password. `$pass`.
    Do not touch the `$db` variable, since it contains the name of the default database.

and you can test your chat.
